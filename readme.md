# AnonDev API bot

This project is a Discord bot that is powered by [AnonDev API](https://api.anondev.ml). We are using gcommands slash/normal cmd handler which extends Discord.js v13.

### How do I use this?

- Create .env file with using .env.example and fill it with your details.
  You can get AnonDev API key on [Pinglik Support Server](https://go.anondev.ml/pinglik-support) by using `/getapikey` slash command.
- Make sure you have nodejs v16 installed (this is required for discord.js v13).
- Make sure to enable Intents for your bot on Discord developer portal and make sure to invite the bot with application command permissions to your server(s) so the bot can register slash commands.

- Start it by running:

`npm install` - Install dependencies

`npm start or node index.js` - Start the project
